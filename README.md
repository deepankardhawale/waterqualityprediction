# Water Potability Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the potability of water samples using machine learning. By analyzing features such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, and more, the model classifies whether water is potable (safe to drink) or not.

## Features
- **Dataset Analysis**: Statistical summaries and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- **Model Building**: 
  - Utilizes Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for predictions.
  - Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search and Cross-Validation to optimize performance.
- **Prediction**: 
  - Real-time prediction capabilities using trained models.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy scores and optimal hyperparameters for robust performance metrics.
